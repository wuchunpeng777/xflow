description: Completes an xflow feature and writes its release note. Use when the user invokes /xflow-complete, xflow complete, /xflow:complete, or asks to finish a feature spec.

# xflow Complete

## Purpose

Complete a feature, summarize the work, and maintain a release file under `.xflow/releases/`.

Do not pre-generate `.xflow/`. Create directories and files only when this command needs them and they do not already exist.

## Command

Accept these forms as equivalent:

- `/xflow-complete <feature-name>`
- `/xflow:complete <feature-name>`
- `xflow complete <feature-name>`

## Workflow

1. Read the active task spec from `.xflow/tasks/<feature-name>.md`, using the exact `<feature-name>` from the user's complete command.
2. Inspect code and Git state as the source of truth.
3. If the task spec, code, or Git state is not enough to write background, changes, impact, and risks, ask focused clarification questions before writing the release entry.
4. Ensure `.xflow/releases/` exists.
5. Use `.xflow/releases/<feature-name>.md` as the release file path.
6. If the release file does not exist, create it from the Release File Template and add the current release entry.
7. If the release file already exists, prepend the current release entry to the top of the release log, keeping older entries below it.
8. Each release entry must include background, changes, impact, and risks.
9. Delete the completed task spec unless the user asks to keep it.
10. After complete finishes, automatically ask the user whether to run learn to capture durable project knowledge. Only if the user confirms, continue into the xflow-learn workflow using the user's topic or the current feature name.

## Naming

- Task spec: `.xflow/tasks/<feature-name>.md`
- Release file: `.xflow/releases/<feature-name>.md`
- Preserve the user's command name exactly, including language, spelling, casing, and separators.
- Do not translate, summarize, lowercase, kebab-case, or otherwise rewrite the name.

## Release File Template

```markdown
# Release: <name>

## Release Log
```

## Release Entry Template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD <summary>

#### 背景

#### 改动

#### 影响

#### 风险
```

## Principles

- Code + Git = truth.
- Release Note = historical summary.
- Spec = temporary context.
